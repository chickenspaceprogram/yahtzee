YAHTZEE RULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) INTRODUCTION / QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yahtzee is a dice game, where you get points by using dice that you roll to make
scoring combinations.

To start, select `2 : Start a game of Yahtzee` from the Main Menu, then press
[Enter]. Alternately, if you want to leave, select `3 : Exit`. 

After selecting option 2, you will be shown your current score, and you can
press any key to continue. Then, your dice will be rolled. You can select the
dice you don't want to roll, and either press [Space] to reroll the rest or
[Enter] to stop rolling the dice and score your current roll, if you're already
happy with your rolls.

Then, a menu will be displayed, and you can select the score combination you
want to use the dice towards. You'll then be shown a screen displaying your
score, and you can press any key to let the game continue and allow the other
player to have their turn.

You can only select each combination once, so choose wisely! Once both players
run out of combinations to choose, their scores will be displayed and the game
will end.
